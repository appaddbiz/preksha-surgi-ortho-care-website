        description:
          "Endoscopy and colonoscopy are advanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that allow doctors to directly visualize the digestive tract. These techniques help detect and treat conditions such as acid reflux, gastritis, ulcers, polyps, gastrointestinal bleeding, and even early-stage cancers. Unlike traditional imaging, endoscopy provides a real-time, clear view of the esophagus, stomach, intestines, and colon, enabling precise diagnosis and timely treatment decisions.",

        title: "Why Choose These Procedures?",
        description:
          "At Preksha Surgi & Ortho Care, we use state-of-the-art, high-definition endoscopic equipment to ensure accurate results and patient comfort. Endoscopy is often recommended for symptoms like unexplained abdominal pain, vomiting, indigestion, or difficulty swallowing. Colonoscopy is highly effective for detecting colon polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, and colorectal cancer. By identifying these conditions early, we help patients avoid complications and improve long-term health outcomes.",
